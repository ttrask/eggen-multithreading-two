TITLE: 	Scala Thread Actor class.
AUTOHR: 	THOMAS TRASK
STARTDATE: 12-5-2012

PURPOSE: 	This where all of the Actor communication magic happens.
 			The act() method starts a "listener" that will accept any of
    		the Scala Message classes.  The Client and server both instantiate
      		an actor and use them to communicate with each other.
